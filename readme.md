# Connor Banks Tamminen's Professional Portfolio

## Description

My goal was to create a portfolio for myself that contains information on the projects i've created and how to contact me.
This site allows users to learn more about me and the projects that I have created.

## Usage

Users can click on any of the four subjects listed in the top left hand side of the page and the site will automatically scroll the user to a section of the page that provides details on whichever subject the user clicked.

## Credits
